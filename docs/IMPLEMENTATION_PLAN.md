# AI-Driven Implementation Plan: D&D Encounter Tracker (Express/React)

**Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Duration:** 8-10 weeks to production launch  
**Approach:** AI-accelerated development with modern Express/React architecture

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan leverages AI agents for rapid development of the D&D Encounter Tracker using a modern Express/React stack. By maintaining separation between frontend and backend, we achieve better control over authentication, easier debugging, and more deployment flexibility compared to Next.js alternatives.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Why Express/React Over Next.js

1. **Authentication Control**: Full control over session management without framework constraints
2. **Debugging Clarity**: Explicit middleware chain for easier troubleshooting
3. **Deployment Flexibility**: No vendor lock-in, deploy anywhere
4. **Backend Portability**: API can serve any frontend framework
5. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-grained caching control

### Modern Stack Highlights

- **Express.js** with TypeScript for robust API development
- **React + Vite** for lightning-fast frontend development
- **Prisma ORM** replacing Mongoose for better TypeScript integration
- **Lucia Auth** for modern session management
- **Server-Sent Events** for real-time updates without WebSocket complexity
- **Comprehensive testing** with Vitest and Playwright
