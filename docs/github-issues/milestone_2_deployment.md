# Milestone 2: Initial Deployment & User Testing Infrastructure (End of Week 1)

**Due Date**: End of Week 1  
**Goal**: Deploy basic infrastructure for continuous user testing throughout development

## Overview

This milestone establishes the foundation for continuous deployment and user testing. By implementing early deployment infrastructure, we can gather user feedback from Week 1 onwards, enabling iterative development and early validation of features.

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration

**Staging Environment**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.staging.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: dnd-tracker:staging
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=staging
      - DATABASE_URL=${STAGING_DATABASE_URL}
      - REDIS_URL=${STAGING_REDIS_URL}
      - FEATURE_FLAGS=early_access,feedback_widget
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.staging.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl
```

**Feature Flags**:
```typescript
// Feature flags for staging
const STAGING_FEATURES = {
  early_access: true,
  feedback_widget: true,
  advanced_combat: false,
  premium_features: false,
  real_time_sync: false
};
```

### Testing Strategy

**Week 1 Testing Focus**:
1. **Basic Navigation**: Can users navigate the application?
2. **Registration Flow**: Is the signup process clear?
3. **Overall UX**: First impressions and usability
4. **Performance**: Page load times and responsiveness

**Feedback Collection**:
- In-app feedback widget for immediate input
- Weekly feedback review sessions
- User behavior analytics
- Performance monitoring

## Success Criteria

By the end of Week 1, the staging environment should have:

1. **Automated Deployment**:
   - Working CI/CD pipeline
   - Automatic deployments on develop branch pushes
   - Health checks and rollback capabilities

2. **User Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Feedback collection system
   - Test data seeding
   - Basic landing page with testing info

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Uptime monitoring
   - Error logging
   - Basic user analytics

4. **Documentation**:
   - Deployment procedures
   - Testing guidelines
   - Feedback review process

**Benefits of Early Deployment**:
- **Continuous Feedback**: User input from Week 1 onwards
- **Real-world Testing**: Actual deployment environment testing
- **Team Validation**: Early validation of architecture decisions
- **Risk Mitigation**: Deployment issues discovered early
- **User Engagement**: Early user buy-in and community building

**Next Steps**: With deployment infrastructure ready, development can proceed with authentication (Milestone 3) while continuously deploying and testing new features.
