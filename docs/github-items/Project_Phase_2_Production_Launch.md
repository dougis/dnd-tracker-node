-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   [ ] The webhook correctly processes new `checkout.session.completed` and `customer.subscription.updated` events.
    -   [ ] When the same event is sent twice, it is processed only once, and the second request returns a success status without taking action.

### Issue: Implement Usage Limit Reset Job

-   **Labels:** `priority: high`, `type: feature`, `effort: ai`, `component: backend`, `component: payments`
-   **Details:**
    -   Create a scheduled job using `node-cron` that runs once daily.
    -   The job should query for all active subscriptions whose `currentPeriodEnd` has passed.
    -   For each of these subscriptions, it must reset the `partiesCreated`, `encountersCreated`, and `creaturesCreated` counters in the `Usage` table to 0.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   [ ] The scheduled job runs daily as expected in the production environment.
    -   [ ] When a user's subscription billing period ends, their usage counters are reset to zero on the following day.

### Issue: Implement Full Subscription Management UI
-   **Title:** `feat: Implement full subscription management UI`
-   **Labels:** `priority: high`, `type: feature`, `effort: ai`, `component: frontend`, `component: payments`
-   **Details:**
    -   Create a pricing page that displays all available subscription tiers.
    -   Integrate with the Stripe checkout session endpoint.
    -   Create a billing dashboard where users can see their current plan, manage their subscription (via the Stripe Customer Portal), and view their payment history.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   [ ] Users can select a plan and successfully complete a payment via Stripe Checkout.
    -   [ ] Users can access the Stripe Customer Portal from their billing dashboard.

### Issue: Enhance SSE with Redis and Implement PWA Offline Support
-   **Title:** `feat: Enhance SSE with Redis and implement PWA offline support`
-   **Labels:** `priority: medium`, `type: feature`, `effort: ai`, `component: backend`, `component: frontend`
-   **Details:**
    -   Integrate Redis pub/sub to manage SSE connections for better scalability.
    -   Implement a service worker to provide offline functionality for core features like viewing parties and encounters.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   [ ] The SSE implementation uses Redis to broadcast messages across multiple server instances.
    -   [ ] The application can be loaded and core data can be viewed while the user is offline.
