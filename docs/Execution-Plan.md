## Executive Summary

This execution plan maps the Implementation Plan to specific GitHub issues and provides a roadmap for coordinating development work across multiple engineers or AI agents. The plan identifies critical dependencies that must be completed sequentially and maximizes opportunities for parallel development.

### Key Metrics
- **Total Issues:** 81 (35 existing + 15 new + future planning)
- **Sequential Dependencies:** 5 critical chains identified
- **Parallel Work Streams:** Up to 4 simultaneous work tracks possible
- **Estimated Duration:** 10 weeks to production launch

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Sequential Dependencies** must be respected to avoid merge conflicts
2. **Infrastructure First** - Foundation issues block all feature development
3. **Database Schema** must be complete before API development
4. **Authentication System** must be working before any user-facing features

## Critical Sequential Dependencies

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPENDENCY CHAIN 1: Linting and Code Quality
**Issues must be completed in exact order:**

- [ ] **#65** - Setup Linting tools and automations
- [ ] **#42** - Re-enable ESLint checks and configure properly for monorepo  
- [ ] **#41** - Set up Code coverage reporting to Codacy

**Risk:** All three modify core build configuration. Parallel work will cause merge conflicts.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPENDENCY CHAIN 2: Authentication Foundation
**Rate limiting must complete before subscription systems:**

- [ ] **#17** - Implement production-ready rate limiting
- [ ] **#28** - Implement Free Tier Subscription Logic
- [ ] **#29** - Build Frontend Usage and Upgrade Prompts

**Risk:** Subscription logic depends on rate limiting infrastructure.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPENDENCY CHAIN 3: Database Foundation
**Schema must be established before all API work:**

- [ ] **#66** - Design and implement comprehensive Prisma database schema
- [ ] **#24** - Implement Party and Character Management API
- [ ] **#26** - Implement Combat System MVP Backend

**Risk:** API development impossible without database schema.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPENDENCY CHAIN 4: Frontend Foundation
**Base UI components must exist before feature UIs:**

- [ ] **#21** - Build frontend foundation and authentication UI
- [ ] **#25** - Build frontend for Party and Character Management
- [ ] **#27** - Build Frontend for Combat System MVP

**Risk:** Feature UIs depend on base component library and authentication.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPENDENCY CHAIN 5: Payment Integration
**Backend must be working before frontend:**

- [ ] **#14** - Implement comprehensive Stripe integration
- [ ] **#15** - Implement full subscription management UI

**Risk:** Frontend subscription UI cannot function without backend integration.
